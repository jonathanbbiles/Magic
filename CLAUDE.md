# Project memory for Claude

## What this repo is

Live Alpaca crypto trading bot. The full strategy is documented in `README.md` (top level). Read it before making changes — older doc fragments in `backend/README.md` describe features that are documented but not implemented (stops, Kelly sizing, drawdown guard, correlation guard, TWAP, engine v2). Treat any env var not listed in the top-level `README.md` as not-wired until confirmed by `grep` in `backend/`.

## Hard rules

1. **Keep `README.md` (top level) current.** If a change affects any of the following, the same PR must update `README.md`:
   - Trading behavior (entry logic, exit math, fee model, gates).
   - Default values for env vars listed in the README's "Environment variables" table.
   - The "What the bot does NOT do" list (e.g. if a stop-loss is ever added, the README must say so).
   - Repo layout (new top-level directories, renamed top-level files).
   - Production deployment posture.

   Concretely: if your diff touches `backend/trade.js`, `backend/config/liveDefaults.js`, `backend/.env.example`, or top-level structure, also update `README.md` in the same commit.

2. **Never commit Alpaca credentials or `API_TOKEN` values.** A pre-commit hook in `.git-hooks/pre-commit` blocks the obvious cases, but never bypass it with `--no-verify`.

3. **Live trading only.** `TRADE_BASE` must point at `https://api.alpaca.markets` in production; paper endpoints are explicitly rejected. Don't add fallbacks that re-allow paper.

4. **Don't re-introduce dead knobs as if they're real.** If you add documentation for a feature, the feature must actually be wired. The current backend has substantial doc-vs-code drift; do not make it worse.

5. **Don't add stop-loss, max-hold, or force-exit logic without explicit user instruction.** The "walk away after placing the GTC sell" behavior is intentional design, not a missing feature.

## Useful commands

```sh
cd backend
npm test                  # full grouped test suite
npm run smoke             # local smoke test
npm run preflight         # runtime-env check + smoke
npm run check:complexity  # line budget for trade.js
npm run reconcile         # offline predicted vs realized analysis
```
