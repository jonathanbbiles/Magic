# Magic — Alpaca Crypto Trading Bot

Automated crypto trading bot that runs on Alpaca's **live** trading API. It scans a configured set of crypto pairs every few seconds, opens a small position when recent price action looks favorable, and immediately sets a take-profit limit on fill.

> **This is a live trading system. Real money is at risk every time it runs.** Never point it at production until you've read the [Production deployment](#production-deployment) section.

---

## Goals

- Find tiny upward drifts in liquid crypto pairs.
- Capture a small **net profit** per trade after fees (default **0.08%** floor, allowed range **0.05%..0.50%**). Each trade's actual TP is `SIGNAL_TARGET_FRACTION × projectedBps − fees` (default fraction `0.5` = aim to fill at half the predicted move), clamped to `[TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS, SIGNAL_TARGET_MAX_NET_BPS]`.
- **Never realise a loss.** The bot does not market-sell into the book. Instead, the resting GTC sell limit is gradually walked DOWN over `BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 4 h) from the signal-derived TP toward break-even-after-fees (`entry × (1 + FEE_BPS_ROUND_TRIP/10000)`) and pinned there. Worst-case realised P&L per trade is **$0 net** (assuming the limit eventually fills). Hard stop-loss (`STOP_LOSS_ENABLED`) is OFF by default; flip it on if you want the legacy force-exit-on-bid behaviour back.
- Run unattended on a single Render instance.
- Concurrency is bounded by available cash, not a fixed slot count.

## The whole strategy in 5 lines

1. Every `ENTRY_SCAN_INTERVAL_MS` (default 12 s), scan the entry universe. By default `ENTRY_UNIVERSE_MODE=dynamic`, which scans **every active Alpaca crypto pair** (USD-quoted, ex-stablecoins) — typically 30+ symbols — and lets the per-symbol gates downstream do the actual filtering. Setting `ENTRY_UNIVERSE_MODE=configured` instead restricts the scan to `ENTRY_SYMBOLS_PRIMARY` (BTC, ETH, SOL, AVAX, LINK, UNI, DOT, ADA, XRP, DOGE, LTC, BCH by default). Note that the per-symbol gates (`SPREAD_MAX_BPS=30`, `ENTRY_QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS=60000`) are calibrated for tier-1 liquidity; in dynamic mode they reject long-tail alts for stale quotes or wide spreads, so the *effective* trade set tends to be tier-1-equivalent symbols (BTC/ETH-class) even though the scan walks the full universe. Raise `SPREAD_MAX_BPS` / `ENTRY_QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS` to extend reach to thinner pairs.
2. For each symbol, fit a linear regression on the last `PREDICT_BARS` (default 20) one-minute closes. Convert the slope's t-statistic to an upward probability via the logistic CDF.
3. If the symbol clears the spread gate, the higher-timeframe slope filter, and the net-edge gate, place a **GTC limit BUY at the current ask**.
4. When the buy fills, immediately place **one GTC limit SELL** at:
   ```
   entry × (1 + (signalDerivedNetBps + FEE_BPS_ROUND_TRIP) / 10000)
   ```
   where `signalDerivedNetBps = clamp(SIGNAL_TARGET_FRACTION × projectedBps − FEE_BPS_ROUND_TRIP, TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS, SIGNAL_TARGET_MAX_NET_BPS)`. The exit target is **per-trade**: with `SIGNAL_TARGET_FRACTION=0.5` (default), the TP aims to fill at **half** the predicted move, trading smaller per-trade profit for materially higher fill probability under unbiased predictions. Confident signals (high `projectedBps`) get bigger TPs; marginal signals fall back to the `TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS` floor (default 8 bps net = `entry × 1.0048`). Set `SIGNAL_TARGET_FRACTION=1.0` to target the full prediction (legacy 100%-of-projection behaviour); set `SIGNAL_SIZED_EXIT_ENABLED=false` to revert to fixed `TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS` for every trade.
5. **Staircase exit (no realised losses).** From the moment the buy fills, every reconcile cycle (`EXIT_SCAN_INTERVAL_MS`) computes a desired GTC sell limit that decays linearly from the signal-derived TP at fill time toward break-even-after-fees (`entry × (1 + FEE_BPS_ROUND_TRIP/10000)`) over `BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 4 hours). When the desired price drops at least `STAIRCASE_REPOST_TOLERANCE_BPS` below the resting limit, the engine cancels and reposts at the new lower price. The age anchor is **restart-resilient**: it uses the older of (broker GTC sell `created_at`, in-memory `positionFirstSeenAt`), so positions opened well before a deploy resume their staircase decay instead of resetting to t=0 on reboot. The floor is the break-even-after-fees price — the bot never reposts below it, so every fill yields **≥ $0 net**. A position can stay parked at the break-even limit indefinitely if price never recovers, but no realised loss is ever booked. **Hard stop-loss is OFF by default** (`STOP_LOSS_ENABLED=false`); set it to `true` on Render to re-enable the legacy force-exit-on-bid behaviour with the per-trade vol-scaled stop (`stopLossBpsResolved ≈ STOP_LOSS_VOL_K × volatilityBps × √STOP_LOSS_HORIZON_BARS`, clamped to `[STOP_LOSS_BPS_FLOOR, STOP_LOSS_BPS]`). When `STAIRCASE_EXIT_ENABLED=false`, the engine falls back to the legacy one-shot break-even reset at `T = BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS`.

There is no fixed concurrency cap. The engine opens as many positions as `PORTFOLIO_SIZING_PCT` of equity will fund (one per symbol). Once cash falls below `MIN_TRADE_NOTIONAL_USD`, new entries are skipped until a position closes.

Everything else in the codebase is plumbing, telemetry, and safety rails around those five steps.

## The math, briefly

- **Entry signal** (`backend/modules/entryProbability.js`): OLS slope on recent 1m closes → t-statistic → logistic CDF for `pUp` ∈ [0, 1].
- **Forward fill probability** (`backend/modules/entryEconomics.js`, default ON via `CORRECTED_FILL_PROB_ENABLED`): closed-form GBM barrier-hitting probability that the bid will reach the take-profit price within `BARRIER_HORIZON_BARS` (default = `BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS` in minutes), using the OLS slope as drift μ and recent realised 1m volatility as σ. Replaces the previous `logistic_cdf(slopeTStat)` proxy, which measured *significance of the past slope* rather than the forward chance the TP fills. Set `CORRECTED_FILL_PROB_ENABLED=false` to roll back.
- **Cost floor** (`ENFORCE_GROSS_TARGET_FLOOR`, default ON): refuse trades whose static `GROSS_TARGET_BPS = TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS + FEE_BPS_ROUND_TRIP` is below `spread + ENTRY_SLIPPAGE_BPS + EXIT_SLIPPAGE_BPS + FEE_BPS_ROUND_TRIP + MIN_NET_EDGE_BPS`. Pure accounting: trades that cannot beat their own friction never enter, regardless of signal strength.
- **Net edge gate** (`backend/modules/tradeGuards.js`): expected `(targetNetBps − slippageBps) × fillProbability` must clear `MIN_NET_EDGE_BPS`.
- **Honest-EV gate** (`HONEST_EV_GATE_ENABLED`, default OFF): when on, charges the non-fill branch an assumed `STUCK_LOSS_ASSUMED_BPS` MTM penalty so the EV calculation reflects the strategy's asymmetric "no stop-loss" structure rather than treating every miss as 0 P&L. Off by default because the assumption is regime-dependent — flip it on once you've calibrated against `node backend/scripts/simulate_strategy.js`.
- **Spread gate**: skip if `spreadBps > SPREAD_MAX_BPS`.
- **HTF filter**: optional second-timeframe slope sanity check (`HTF_*` knobs).
- **Volatility gate**: skip if realized vol exceeds `VOLATILITY_MAX_BPS`.
- **Exit price**: a static GTC limit, never a stop or trailing exit.

### Diagnosing expectancy

Two scripts exist to answer "is this strategy actually profitable?":

```sh
cd backend
npm run reconcile                                    # compare predicted vs realised on live forensics data
node scripts/simulate_strategy.js                    # closed-form Monte Carlo across drift/vol regimes
node scripts/simulate_strategy.js --regime=adverse   # single-regime detail
node scripts/simulate_strategy.js --json             # machine-readable for charts
```

The simulator's headline finding under live defaults (target 20 bps net, 40 bps fees, 10-min break-even timeout, 12 bps/min realised vol): expectancy is **strongly negative under flat or adverse drift** because the no-stop-loss design parks capital in stuck positions whose MTM keeps decaying. Only sustained positive drift produces a small positive expectancy (~+1 bps per trade at +0.5 bps/min drift). This is the math justification for the corrected fill-probability model and the cost-floor gate above.

## Setup

Requires Node 22 (`nvm use` in `backend/`).

```sh
cd backend
npm install            # postinstall wires up .git-hooks
cp .env.example .env   # fill in live Alpaca keys (never commit secrets)
npm test
npm run smoke
npm start
```

Frontend (optional, diagnostic only):
```sh
cd Frontend
npm install
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 npx expo start -c
```

---

## Environment variables (the ones actually wired)

> If you see env vars referenced in older doc fragments that aren't listed here, treat them as **not wired** until you confirm with `grep` in `backend/`. Several "bulletproof" knobs in legacy docs (stop-loss, Kelly sizing, drawdown guard, correlation guard, TWAP, etc.) are documented but not implemented.

### Required for live trading
| Var | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `APCA_API_KEY_ID` | Alpaca key (or aliases `ALPACA_KEY_ID`, `ALPACA_API_KEY_ID`, `ALPACA_API_KEY`). |
| `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY` | Alpaca secret (or `ALPACA_SECRET_KEY`, `ALPACA_API_SECRET_KEY`). |
| `TRADE_BASE` | Must be `https://api.alpaca.markets` in production. Paper endpoints rejected. |
| `DATA_BASE` | `https://data.alpaca.markets`. |
| `API_TOKEN` | Required in production. Protects every mutating endpoint (`/buy`, `/trade`, `POST /orders`, `DELETE /orders/:id`) and most debug endpoints. The frontend's read-only endpoints (`GET /dashboard`, `GET /debug/logs`) plus `GET /health`, `GET /debug/auth`, `GET /debug/status` are public so the diagnostic Expo app works without bundling a token. Trading endpoints stay locked. |

### Strategy economics (defaults in parentheses)
| Var | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS` | `8` | **Floor** for the per-trade exit target after fees (8 bps = 0.08%). Default lowered from 15 bps so the `SIGNAL_TARGET_FRACTION=0.5` multiplier actually has room to bite for typical projections — with the old 15-bps floor the fractional formula was a no-op. When `SIGNAL_SIZED_EXIT_ENABLED=true` (default), each entry's TP is sized from that entry's own `projectedBps`, clamped to `[TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS, SIGNAL_TARGET_MAX_NET_BPS]`. Code clamps the configured floor itself to `[5, 50]` bps. |
| `SIGNAL_TARGET_FRACTION` | `0.5` | Fraction of the OLS-projected forward move the GTC sell limit aims to capture: `signalNet = fraction × projectedBps − fees`. `0.5` = fill at half the predicted move (higher fill rate, smaller per-trade profit). `1.0` = legacy 100%-of-projection behaviour. Code clamps to `[0.1, 2.0]`. |
| `SIGNAL_SIZED_EXIT_ENABLED` | `true` | When ON, the GTC sell limit is set per-trade from the entry's `projectedBps`. When OFF, every trade exits at the fixed `TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS` regardless of signal strength (legacy behaviour). |
| `SIGNAL_TARGET_MAX_NET_BPS` | `50` | **Cap** on the per-trade signal-sized net target. Bigger projections than this are clamped down to 50 bps net (= `entry × 1.0090`). Code clamps the configured cap to `[TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS, 50]`. |
| `FEE_BPS_ROUND_TRIP` | `40` | Assumed Alpaca round-trip: ~25 bps taker entry + ~15 bps maker exit. |
| `PROFIT_BUFFER_BPS` | `5` | Cushion used in entry edge gate. The gate requires `spread ≤ TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS − PROFIT_BUFFER_BPS`, so with the default 20 bps target the effective entry spread headroom is 15 bps (well inside `SPREAD_MAX_BPS`). Raising it tightens entries toward BTC-only; setting it to 0 lets `SPREAD_MAX_BPS` become the only spread filter. |
| `MIN_NET_EDGE_BPS` | `2` | Minimum expected net edge (bps) to clear before buying. Computed as `(TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS − ENTRY_SLIPPAGE_BPS) × fillProbability`. With the scalper-friendly defaults (`TARGET=15`, `slip=3`), the EV check is `12 × p ≥ 2` ⇒ p ≥ ~0.17 — comfortably looser than the slope-positive guard (p > 0.5 ⇔ t > 0). The binding economic gate is therefore `alpha_below_execution_cost` (projected move > 0). Realised wins per fill are still `+TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS` after fees because the GTC take-profit price is fixed; this knob only widens which candidates are eligible to attempt that win. |
| `PORTFOLIO_SIZING_PCT` | `0.10` | Fraction of equity per trade. |
| `MIN_TRADE_NOTIONAL_USD` | `1` | Dust floor below which buys are skipped. |
| `BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS` | `14400000` | Time over which the staircase exit decays the GTC sell limit from the signal-derived TP to break-even-after-fees. Default 4 hours. Floor: 30 000. Also used as the fallback one-shot break-even-replace deadline when `STAIRCASE_EXIT_ENABLED=false`. |
| `STAIRCASE_EXIT_ENABLED` | `true` | When ON (default), each reconcile cycle linearly decays the GTC sell limit from the initial signal-derived TP to break-even-after-fees (`entry × (1 + FEE_BPS_ROUND_TRIP/10000)`) over `BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS`. The floor is hard: the bot never reposts below break-even, so realised P&L per trade is bounded at $0 net. When OFF, falls back to the legacy one-shot break-even-replace at `T = BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS`. |
| `STAIRCASE_REPOST_TOLERANCE_BPS` | `3` | Minimum drop (bps) between the resting limit and the staircase-desired limit before the engine cancels and reposts. Prevents churning cancel/repost on tiny age increments. Floor: 0.5. |
| `STOP_LOSS_ENABLED` | `false` | **OFF by default.** When ON, the exit manager monitors live bid and force-exits with a market `IOC` sell if the stop is breached — i.e. the bot will realise a loss. The default-OFF posture means the staircase exit is the only post-fill risk lever and worst-case realised P&L per trade is $0 net. Flip to `true` on Render only if you accept booking losses for capital recycling. |
| `STOP_LOSS_BPS` | `100` | **Cap** on the stop-loss distance below entry (bps). When `VOL_SCALED_STOP_ENABLED=true` (default), the actual per-trade stop is sized from entry-time volatility and is usually tighter than this cap. When `VOL_SCALED_STOP_ENABLED=false`, this is the fixed stop for every trade. |
| `VOL_SCALED_STOP_ENABLED` | `true` | When ON, each trade's stop distance is sized at entry from realised volatility: `stopBps ≈ STOP_LOSS_VOL_K × σ × √STOP_LOSS_HORIZON_BARS`, clamped to `[STOP_LOSS_BPS_FLOOR, STOP_LOSS_BPS]`. Same risk in σ-units across regimes. |
| `STOP_LOSS_VOL_K` | `1.0` | Number of σ used in the vol-scaled stop formula. Larger = wider stops (more breathing room, fewer stop-outs, bigger losses when they fire). |
| `STOP_LOSS_HORIZON_BARS` | `60` | Horizon (in 1-min bars) over which σ is integrated. Default 60 = "1-σ move over the next hour." Larger = wider stops. |
| `STOP_LOSS_BPS_FLOOR` | `20` | Floor for the vol-scaled stop. Protects against vol-calc collapse in dead markets where σ ≈ 0 would yield a near-zero stop and instant whipsaw. |
| `ENTRY_SLIPPAGE_BPS` | `3` | Slippage budget on the entry side. Used in the cost-floor and net-edge gates; lowered from 5 so a 10–15 bps net target can clear the friction floor. |
| `EXIT_SLIPPAGE_BPS` | `3` | Slippage budget on the exit side. Same rationale as ENTRY_SLIPPAGE_BPS. |
| `CORRECTED_FILL_PROB_ENABLED` | `true` | Use the closed-form GBM barrier-hitting probability (`backend/modules/entryEconomics.js`) as `fillProbability` in the EV gate. When `false`, falls back to the legacy `logistic_cdf(slopeTStat)` proxy. Both values are still logged in `entry_submitted` for parity tracking. |
| `ENFORCE_GROSS_TARGET_FLOOR` | `true` | Refuse trades whose static `GROSS_TARGET_BPS` is below `spread + ENTRY_SLIPPAGE_BPS + EXIT_SLIPPAGE_BPS + FEE_BPS_ROUND_TRIP + MIN_NET_EDGE_BPS`. Pure cost accounting — trades that cannot pay for their own friction never enter. Skip reason: `gross_target_below_friction_floor`. |
| `HONEST_EV_GATE_ENABLED` | `false` | When `true`, the EV calculation charges the non-fill branch a `STUCK_LOSS_ASSUMED_BPS` penalty so the asymmetric "no stop-loss" structure is priced honestly (`E[net] = p·targetNet − (1−p)·stuckLoss`). Off by default because the stuck-loss assumption is regime-dependent. Skip reason: `honest_ev_below_min`. |
| `STUCK_LOSS_ASSUMED_BPS` | `100` | Bps of MTM loss assumed for positions that don't recover above break-even. Only consulted when `HONEST_EV_GATE_ENABLED=true`. Calibrate by running `node scripts/simulate_strategy.js` and reading `avg_loss` for your target regime. |
| `BARRIER_HORIZON_BARS` | `BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS / 60000` | Number of 1-minute bars used as the horizon in the barrier-hitting probability. Defaults to the break-even timeout in minutes — answers "how likely is the TP to fill before we'd otherwise replace it with a break-even sell?". |

### Scanner / data
| Var | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ENTRY_SCAN_INTERVAL_MS` | `12000` | How often the entry loop runs. |
| `EXIT_SCAN_INTERVAL_MS` | `15000` | How often exit/state poll runs. |
| `ENTRY_QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS` | `60000` | Reject quotes staler than this. |
| `SPREAD_MAX_BPS` | `30` | Skip symbols whose spread exceeds this. |
| `PREDICT_BARS` | `20` | Bars used in the entry OLS regression. |
| `VOLATILITY_MAX_BPS` | `100` | Skip if realized vol exceeds this. |
| `HTF_FILTER_ENABLED` | `true` | Gate on higher-timeframe slope. |
| `HTF_BARS` | `12` | HTF lookback. |
| `HTF_MIN_SLOPE_BPS_PER_BAR` | `0` | HTF slope floor. |
| `HTTP_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Per-request HTTP timeout. |

### Universe
| Var | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `ENTRY_UNIVERSE_MODE` | Default `dynamic` — scanner walks **every** active Alpaca crypto pair (USD-quoted, ex-stablecoins) returned by `/v2/assets`, typically 30+ symbols. Per-symbol entry gates (`SPREAD_MAX_BPS`, `ENTRY_QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS`) are tier-1-tight by default, so long-tail alts get rejected and the effective live trade set is BTC/ETH-class pairs even though the scan is wide. Set to `configured` to restrict the scan to `ENTRY_SYMBOLS_PRIMARY` instead — useful when you want explicit control over which symbols are even considered. To extend reach to thinner pairs while staying in dynamic mode, raise `SPREAD_MAX_BPS` / `ENTRY_QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS`. |
| `ENTRY_SYMBOLS_PRIMARY` | The configured-mode universe. Default `BTC/USD,ETH/USD,SOL/USD,AVAX/USD,LINK/USD,UNI/USD,DOT/USD,ADA/USD,XRP/USD,DOGE/USD,LTC/USD,BCH/USD` (12 deep-liquidity USD-quoted crypto pairs on Alpaca). Ignored when `ENTRY_UNIVERSE_MODE=dynamic` (the default). |
| `ALLOW_DYNAMIC_UNIVERSE_IN_PRODUCTION` | Default `true` so production can opt into dynamic without an extra flag. The runtime validator only blocks production startup if mode is `dynamic` AND this flag is `false`. |

### Toggles
| Var | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TRADING_ENABLED` | `true` | Kill-switch for the buy path. |
| `NET_EDGE_GATE_ENABLED` | `true` | Disabling lets all entries skip the edge gate. |

The validated env-var list lives in `backend/config/validateEnv.js`. Non-secret production defaults live in `backend/config/liveDefaults.js`.

## Tests & scripts

```sh
cd backend
npm test                  # check:no-secrets + grouped suites
npm run smoke             # local smoke test
npm run preflight         # runtime-env check + smoke
npm run check:complexity  # enforces line budget on trade.js
npm run reconcile         # offline analysis: predicted vs realized hit rate
```

CI runs on every push/PR to `main`:
- **backend**: `npm ci` → `npm run lint` → `npm test` → runtime env sanity check.
- **frontend**: `npm ci` (install-only smoke).

See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

---

## What the bot does NOT do (intentional)

- **No realised loss by default.** With `STOP_LOSS_ENABLED=false` (the default), the bot never market-sells into the book. The staircase exit walks the GTC sell limit from the signal-derived TP down to break-even-after-fees and pins it there — so a fill always yields ≥ $0 net. Stuck positions are accepted in exchange for a hard $0 floor on realised P&L per trade.
- **No trailing stop.** Even when `STOP_LOSS_ENABLED=true`, the stop is static at fill time (vol-scaled, but fixed once the position opens), not adaptive.
- **No leverage.**
- **No averaging down or pyramiding.**
- **No cross-symbol correlation guard.** When `ENTRY_UNIVERSE_MODE=dynamic` and 30+ pairs are in scope, the engine can become long the same beta on multiple symbols simultaneously.
- **No Kelly sizing, drawdown guard, kill-switch file watcher, or TWAP execution.** Older docs mention env vars for these — they are not implemented.

The staircase exit (decay TP toward break-even over `BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS`) is the only post-fill exit lever in the default configuration. Stop-loss is opt-in.

### Known structural limitation of "small TP + long-hold tail"

Honest expectancy of the live strategy under realistic 1-minute crypto volatility (σ ≈ 12 bps/min) is **negative in flat or adverse drift regimes**, even though the engine *appears* loss-free because no realised loss is ever booked. Stuck positions accumulate negative MTM that the engine never crystallises. The simulator at `backend/scripts/simulate_strategy.js` quantifies this:

| Regime | Drift (bps/min) | TP fill rate | Stuck rate | Expectancy (bps/trade) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| benign | +0.5 | 5.5% | 0.0% | +1.00 |
| flat | 0 | 4.2% | 3.7% | −49 |
| adverse | −0.5 | 3.4% | 33.7% | −1382 |
| quiet | 0 (σ=6) | 0.0% | 7.1% | −51 |
| wild | 0 (σ=25) | 28.5% | 2.4% | −55 |

(20 000 trials per regime, default fees/spread.) The cost-floor gate and corrected fill probability raise the bar entries must clear — they do not change the structural payoff. Three options if expectancy keeps coming back negative in production:
1. Widen `TARGET_NET_PROFIT_BPS` materially (e.g., 50–80 bps) so winners pay for the stuck tail. The simulator shows this *alone* is insufficient — fill rates collapse roughly proportionally.
2. Enable `HONEST_EV_GATE_ENABLED=true` with a `STUCK_LOSS_ASSUMED_BPS` you trust, accepting that this will starve entries in any regime that isn't trending up.
3. Tighten `STOP_LOSS_BPS` and/or shorten `BREAKEVEN_TIMEOUT_MS` for faster loss realization and capital recycling in adverse regimes.

---

## Production deployment

The production instance runs on Render. Before pointing the bot at a funded account:

1. Set every secret (`APCA_API_KEY_ID`, `APCA_API_SECRET_KEY`, `API_TOKEN`) directly in the Render env. Never in git.
2. `npm run check:runtime-env` to validate config.
3. Leave `ENTRY_UNIVERSE_MODE` unset (default `dynamic`) so the scanner walks every active Alpaca USD-quoted crypto pair minus stablecoins. The tier-1-tight `SPREAD_MAX_BPS=30` / `ENTRY_QUOTE_MAX_AGE_MS=60000` gates filter the long tail, so the effective live trade set converges on liquid pairs (BTC/ETH-class). Set `ENTRY_UNIVERSE_MODE=configured` only if you want to lock the scan to a specific symbol list (`ENTRY_SYMBOLS_PRIMARY`). The boot warning `config_warning field=ENTRY_UNIVERSE_MODE` is informational under the default posture: it just means you have not relaxed the spread/freshness gates beyond their tier-1 calibration.
4. After deploy, `GET /debug/runtime-config` (token-protected) is the source of truth for what the live process actually sees.
5. Verify `effectiveUniverseMode=dynamic` and `scanSymbolsCount` reports a number on the order of all active Alpaca crypto USD pairs (typically 30+) in the `startup_truth_summary` log line. If you switched to `configured`, expect `scanSymbolsCount` to match `ENTRY_SYMBOLS_PRIMARY` length.

Operational details, the full env-var reference, and tuning notes live in `backend/README.md`.

### Docker

```sh
cd backend
docker build --build-arg GIT_COMMIT=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) -t magic-backend .
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env magic-backend
```

Render currently builds without the Dockerfile.

## Known constraints

- Rate limiting (`backend/rateLimit.js`) is in-memory and per-process. Single-instance only.
- The Frontend is read-only diagnostic. It cannot place or modify orders.
- `backend/trade.js` is large; `npm run check:complexity` enforces a soft line cap.
- Crypto markets are 24/7 — there is no "market closed" safe window.

---

## Keeping this README current

This file is the developer's source of truth. **Update it in the same PR as any change that affects:**

- Trading behavior (entry logic, exit math, fee assumptions, gates).
- Default values for any env var listed in [Environment variables](#environment-variables-the-ones-actually-wired).
- Repo layout (new top-level directories, renamed top-level files).
- The "What the bot does NOT do" list — if you add a stop-loss, this README must say so.
- Production deployment posture or Render env requirements.

A change that touches `backend/trade.js`, `backend/config/liveDefaults.js`, `backend/.env.example`, or top-level repo structure should also touch this file. Reviewers should reject PRs that don't.
